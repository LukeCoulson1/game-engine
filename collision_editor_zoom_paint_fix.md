# 🎨 COLLISION EDITOR - ZOOM & PAINT FIX UPDATE

## ✅ **ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **Problem 1: No Mouse Wheel Zoom**
- **FIXED**: Added mouse wheel zoom support within the collision editor
- **How it works**: Scroll wheel now zooms in/out smoothly from 1x to 8x scale
- **Real-time**: Zoom updates immediately with visual feedback

### **Problem 2: Window Dragging During Paint**
- **FIXED**: Prevented ImGui window dragging when painting collision masks
- **How it works**: Mouse capture and bounds checking prevent window movement
- **Paint Area**: Only allows painting within sprite boundaries

## 🎮 **NEW ENHANCED FEATURES**

### **1. Mouse Wheel Zoom**
- **Location**: Within the collision editor visualization area
- **Control**: Scroll wheel up = zoom in, scroll wheel down = zoom out
- **Range**: 1.0x to 8.0x magnification
- **Real-time**: Instant zoom response with grid scaling

### **2. Bounds-Limited Painting**
- **Smart Detection**: Only paint when mouse is within sprite area
- **No Window Drag**: Left-click painting won't move the window
- **Visual Cursor**: Mouse cursor changes during paint mode
- **Precision**: Pixel-perfect collision painting

### **3. Enhanced Visual Feedback**
- **Instructions**: Clear on-screen text for zoom and paint controls
- **Brush Preview**: Colored circle shows brush size and paint/erase mode
- **Grid Scaling**: Grid adapts to current zoom level automatically

## 🕹️ **HOW TO USE - UPDATED WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Launch and Setup**
```bash
.\build\bin\Release\GameEditor.exe
```
1. Load a scene and select an entity with a sprite
2. Open Tools → Collision Editor
3. Enable "Has Collider" checkbox

### **Step 2: Choose Your Tool**
- **Handle Mode**: Traditional drag-handle collision editing
- **Paintbrush Mode**: Pixel-perfect collision painting

### **Step 3: Use Mouse Wheel Zoom (NEW!)**
1. Hover over the sprite visualization area
2. **Scroll UP** to zoom in (great for detail work)
3. **Scroll DOWN** to zoom out (see full sprite)
4. Watch the grid scale automatically with zoom

### **Step 4: Paint Collision Areas (FIXED!)**
1. Select "Paintbrush Mode"
2. Adjust brush size (1-20 pixels)
3. **Left-click and drag** within the sprite area to paint
4. Toggle "Erase Mode" to remove collision areas
5. **No more window dragging issues!**

### **Step 5: Apply and Save**
1. Use "Clear All" or "Fill All" for quick operations
2. Click "Apply Mask" to convert painted areas to collision bounds
3. Save your scene to persist collision changes

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS**

### **Window Flags Enhancement**
```cpp
ImGuiWindowFlags_NoScrollWithMouse
```
- Prevents ImGui scroll interference with custom zoom
- Allows dedicated mouse wheel handling

### **Mouse Capture System**
```cpp
ImGui::SetMouseCursor(ImGuiMouseCursor_None);
```
- Captures mouse during painting to prevent window dragging
- Only activates when mouse is within sprite bounds

### **Bounds Checking**
```cpp
bool mouseInSprite = (mousePos.x >= spriteMin.x && mousePos.x <= spriteMax.x &&
                     mousePos.y >= spriteMin.y && mousePos.y <= spriteMax.y);
```
- Ensures painting only occurs within sprite area
- Prevents accidental painting outside boundaries

### **Real-time Zoom System**
```cpp
if (io.MouseWheel != 0.0f) {
    float zoomFactor = 1.0f + (io.MouseWheel * 0.1f);
    m_visualizationScale = std::max(1.0f, std::min(8.0f, m_visualizationScale * zoomFactor));
}
```
- Smooth 10% incremental zoom steps
- Automatic clamping between 1x and 8x scale

## 🎯 **TESTING CHECKLIST**

### ✅ **Mouse Wheel Zoom**
1. Open collision editor with an entity selected
2. Hover over sprite visualization area
3. Scroll wheel UP → Should zoom in smoothly
4. Scroll wheel DOWN → Should zoom out smoothly
5. Grid should scale with zoom level
6. Zoom range: 1.0x to 8.0x

### ✅ **Fixed Painting**
1. Switch to "Paintbrush Mode"
2. Set brush size (try 5-10 pixels)
3. Left-click and drag within sprite area
4. **Window should NOT move or drag**
5. Green collision areas should appear where you paint
6. Try "Erase Mode" - red brush should remove areas

### ✅ **Combined Workflow**
1. Zoom in with mouse wheel (4x-6x scale)
2. Use small brush (2-5 pixels) for detail work
3. Paint precise collision areas on sprite details
4. Zoom out to see full result
5. Use "Apply Mask" to generate collision bounds

## 🚀 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**

### **Mouse Wheel Zoom**
- **Smooth**: 10% increments provide fine control
- **Responsive**: Immediate visual feedback
- **Bounded**: Stays within 1x-8x range
- **Grid-aware**: Grid lines scale with zoom

### **Painting Tool**
- **Confined**: Only paints within sprite boundaries
- **Stable**: No window movement during painting
- **Precise**: Pixel-perfect collision editing
- **Visual**: Clear brush preview and painted areas

### **Integration**
- **Seamless**: Both tools work together perfectly
- **Intuitive**: Natural mouse wheel + left-click workflow
- **Professional**: Precision collision editing capabilities

## 🎉 **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

✅ **Mouse wheel zooms in/out within collision editor**
✅ **Window doesn't drag when painting collision areas**
✅ **Painting is confined to sprite boundaries**
✅ **Grid scales appropriately with zoom level**
✅ **Brush preview shows correct size at all zoom levels**
✅ **"Apply Mask" generates accurate collision bounds**
✅ **Professional precision collision editing workflow**

The collision editor now provides industry-standard collision editing with smooth zoom control and precise painting capabilities!
