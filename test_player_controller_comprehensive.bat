echo PLAYER CONTROLLER COMPREHENSIVE TEST
echo ================================
echo.
echo This test verifies the complete fix for:
echo 1. No dance animation on Game Logic Window startup
echo 2. Working player controller with WASD movement
echo 3. Auto-addition of required player components
echo 4. Proper input handling and debug logging
echo.
echo ================================
echo TEST SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
echo ================================
echo.
echo BEFORE RUNNING EDITOR:
echo - Ensure you have a clean workspace
echo - No existing scene files that might interfere
echo.
echo IN THE EDITOR:
echo 1. Create new entity (Right-click in Scene Window)
echo 2. Right-click entity → "Edit with Node Editor"
echo 3. In Node Editor, right-click → "Add Component" → "Player Controller"
echo 4. Notice that PlayerController automatically adds:
echo    - PlayerStats (health, mana, experience)
echo    - PlayerPhysics (velocity, acceleration, collision)
echo    - PlayerState (current state, facing direction)
echo    - PlayerAbilities (skills, cooldowns)
echo 5. Close Node Editor
echo 6. Open Game Logic Window
echo 7. Press F5 to start runtime
echo.
echo ================================
echo EXPECTED BEHAVIOR VERIFICATION
echo ================================
echo.
echo ✓ NO DANCE ANIMATION:
echo   - When F5 is pressed, NO automatic dance animation should occur
echo   - Entity should remain stationary until you press movement keys
echo   - No automatic rotation or movement patterns
echo.
echo ✓ WASD MOVEMENT WORKS:
echo   - W key = Move up
echo   - A key = Move left  
echo   - S key = Move down
echo   - D key = Move right
echo   - Hold Shift + WASD = Run (faster movement)
echo   - Space = Jump (if physics enabled)
echo.
echo ✓ DEBUG LOGGING:
echo   - Console should show "Keys pressed: W=1/0 A=1/0 S=1/0 D=1/0" when keys are pressed
echo   - This confirms input is being received correctly
echo.
echo ✓ VISUAL FEEDBACK:
echo   - Entity should move smoothly in Scene Window during runtime
echo   - Movement should be visible in real-time
echo   - Entity should respond immediately to key presses
echo.
echo ================================
echo TROUBLESHOOTING
echo ================================
echo.
echo If movement doesn't work:
echo 1. Ensure entity has Transform component (should be automatic)
echo 2. Verify PlayerController was added via Node Editor
echo 3. Check that all 5 player components were auto-added
echo 4. Make sure Scene Window is visible during runtime
echo 5. Verify F5 was pressed to start runtime
echo.
echo If you see debug messages but no movement:
echo 1. Check that PlayerPhysics component has reasonable values
echo 2. Verify entity is visible in Scene Window
echo 3. Try adding a Sprite component to make entity visible
echo.

echo TEST RESULTS SUMMARY
echo ================================
echo.
echo Please verify that ALL of the following worked:
echo.
echo [ ] No dance animation played automatically when F5 was pressed
echo [ ] WASD keys successfully moved the entity
echo [ ] Debug key press messages appeared in Game Logic Window console
echo [ ] Movement was visible in Scene Window during runtime
echo [ ] Shift+WASD provided faster movement (running)
echo [ ] PlayerController auto-added all required components
echo.
echo If ALL boxes can be checked, the fix is successful!
echo If any issues remain, please check the troubleshooting section above.
