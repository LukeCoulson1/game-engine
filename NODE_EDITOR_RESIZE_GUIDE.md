# Node Editor Resize Functionality

## Overview
The Node Editor now supports resizing nodes by dragging resize handles on selected nodes.

## How to Use

### Selecting a Node
1. Click on any node to select it
2. Selected nodes will show a blue highlight and display a resize handle in the bottom-right corner

### Resizing a Node
1. **First, select a node** by clicking on it
2. **Second, click and drag the resize handle** - the triangular area in the bottom-right corner
3. The mouse cursor will change to a resize cursor (↖↘) when hovering over the resize handle
4. Drag to resize the node to your desired size
5. Release the mouse button to finish resizing

### Important Notes
- **Two-step process**: You must first select a node, then drag the resize handle
- **Resize handles only appear on selected nodes**
- **Canvas won't move during resize**: Fixed issue where canvas would pan instead of resizing

### Size Constraints
- **Minimum Size**: 120x80 pixels (default)
- **Maximum Size**: 400x300 pixels (default)
- **Special Nodes**: Sprite nodes have a minimum size of 200x120 pixels

### Visual Feedback
- **Resize Handle**: A triangular handle appears on selected nodes
- **Mouse Cursor**: Changes to resize cursor when hovering over resize handles
- **Real-time Preview**: Nodes resize in real-time as you drag
- **Selection Highlight**: Selected nodes show a blue highlight

### Troubleshooting
If resizing isn't working:
1. Make sure the node is selected (blue highlight visible)
2. Look for the triangular resize handle in the bottom-right corner
3. Click and drag specifically on the resize handle, not the node body
4. If the canvas moves instead, you're dragging the node body - try clicking closer to the corner

## Technical Details

### Resize Interaction Priority
1. **Resize Handle**: Takes priority when clicking on selected nodes
2. **Node Dragging**: Activated when clicking on node body
3. **Canvas Panning**: Only when not interacting with nodes

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ Canvas no longer pans during resize operations
- ✅ Proper two-step interaction (select first, then resize)
- ✅ Cursor feedback indicates resize vs. drag modes
- ✅ Resize handles only visible on selected nodes
