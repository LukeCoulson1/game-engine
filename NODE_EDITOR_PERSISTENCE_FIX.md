# Node Editor Layout Persistence Fix

## Issues Addressed
1. **Lost Node Positions**: When applying nodes to an entity and then reloading the entity in Node Editor, nodes would appear at default positions instead of where the user left them
2. **Missing Nodes**: Some nodes that were applied would disappear during the apply/reload cycle
3. **Incomplete Component Data**: Component data wasn't always fully preserved between operations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Node Layout Persistence System
**Files Modified**: `NodeEditor.h`, `NodeEditor.cpp`

**New Methods Added**:
- `saveNodeLayout(EntityID entity)` - Saves current node positions and connections to file
- `loadNodeLayout(EntityID entity)` - Restores node positions from saved layout
- `getLayoutFilePath(EntityID entity)` - Generates layout file path for entity

**How It Works**:
- When you apply nodes to an entity (`applyNodesToEntity`), the system now saves the current node layout to `node_layouts/entity_X_layout.txt`
- When you load an entity (`loadEntityAsNodes`), after creating the component nodes, it restores their positions from the saved layout
- Layout files store: node types, positions, names, associated entities, and connections

### 2. Enhanced Component Detection & Data Copying
**Improvements Made**:
- Added comprehensive debug logging to identify which components are found
- Enhanced component data copying to ensure all component properties are preserved
- Fixed component-to-node data synchronization for all component types

**Components Now Fully Supported**:
- ✅ Sprite (texture data preserved)
- ✅ Transform (position, rotation, scale preserved)
- ✅ PlayerController + all player components (stats, physics, inventory, abilities, state)
- ✅ Collider (size and properties preserved)
- ✅ RigidBody (physics properties preserved)
- ✅ EntitySpawner (templates and configuration preserved)
- ✅ ParticleEffect (particle settings preserved)
- ✅ Rotation & Scale (individual transform components)

### 3. Debug Output Enhancement
**Added Debug Messages**:
- Component detection: "Found [ComponentType] component"
- Layout operations: "Saved/Loaded node layout for entity X"
- Position restoration: "Restored position (x, y) for [NodeType] node"
- Component counting: "Found X components for entity Y"

## Technical Details

### Layout File Format
```
# Node Layout for Entity 123
nodes=3
node_id=1
node_type=0
node_name=Entity: Player
position_x=100.0
position_y=100.0
associated_entity=123
---
[additional nodes...]
connections=2
connection_id=1
output_pin=101
input_pin=201
---
[additional connections...]
```

### Workflow Integration
1. **Apply Nodes**: `applyNodesToEntity()` → `saveNodeLayout()` → Layout saved to disk
2. **Load Nodes**: `loadEntityAsNodes()` → Create nodes at default positions → `loadNodeLayout()` → Restore saved positions

### File System Structure
```
game-engine/
├── node_layouts/
│   ├── entity_1_layout.txt
│   ├── entity_2_layout.txt
│   └── ...
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix
- ❌ Nodes scattered at default positions after reload
- ❌ Some applied components would disappear
- ❌ Component data would be lost or reset
- ❌ No feedback about what was happening

### After Fix
- ✅ Nodes appear exactly where you left them
- ✅ All applied components reliably reload
- ✅ Component data fully preserved
- ✅ Clear debug output shows component detection process
- ✅ Persistent layouts across editor sessions

## Testing Instructions
Run `test_node_persistence.bat` for step-by-step testing guidance.

The fix ensures that your visual node arrangements are preserved and all component data remains intact throughout the apply/reload workflow, making the Node Editor much more user-friendly and reliable.
