echo Testing: No Dance Animation + Player Controller Functionality
echo.
echo This test verifies:
echo 1. Dance animation is not automatically executed when Game Logic Window starts
echo 2. Player controller input works correctly (WASD movement)
echo 3. Debug logging shows input when keys are pressed
echo 4. Auto-adding of required player components
echo.
echo UPDATED: PlayerController now auto-adds required components!
echo.
echo Steps to test:
echo 1. Run the editor: build\bin\Release\GameEditor.exe
echo 2. Create a new entity in Scene Window (right-click in scene)
echo 3. Select the entity and open Node Editor (right-click entity)
echo 4. Add a PlayerController component (it will auto-add PlayerStats, PlayerPhysics, etc.)
echo 5. Close Node Editor
echo 6. Open Game Logic Window
echo 7. Press F5 to start runtime
echo 8. Verify no dance animation occurs
echo 9. Press WASD keys to test movement
echo 10. Check console for debug key press messages
echo 11. Press Shift+F5 to stop runtime
echo.
echo Expected results:
echo - No automatic dance animation
echo - Entity moves with WASD keys (hold for continuous movement)
echo - Debug messages appear in console for key presses
echo - Movement is visible in Scene Window during runtime
echo - Shift key makes movement faster (running)
echo - Space key triggers jump (if physics enabled)
echo.
echo IMPORTANT: The PlayerController now automatically adds:
echo - PlayerStats (health, mana, experience, etc.)
echo - PlayerPhysics (velocity, acceleration, collision)
echo - PlayerState (current state, facing direction)
echo - PlayerAbilities (skills, cooldowns)
echo.
