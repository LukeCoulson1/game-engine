# 🎨 Texture Path Serialization Fix - Scene Save/Load Complete

## Problem Solved
**Issue**: When loading a scene, entities did not have their sprite images/textures restored, even though all other Sprite component properties (visibility, layer, tint, source rectangle) were correctly saved and loaded.

## Root Cause
The scene save/load system was saving all Sprite component properties except the actual texture reference. The texture was stored as a `std::shared_ptr<Texture>` but there was no serialization of the original file path needed to recreate the texture.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Texture Class to Store File Path
**File**: `src/graphics/Renderer.h` and `src/graphics/Renderer.cpp`

- Added `std::string m_filepath` member to store original file path
- Added `getFilePath()` method to retrieve the path
- Updated constructor to accept filepath parameter
- Modified `loadTexture()` to pass filepath to Texture constructor

```cpp
class Texture {
    // ... existing members ...
    const std::string& getFilePath() const { return m_filepath; }
private:
    std::string m_filepath; // Store the original file path for serialization
};
```

### 2. Enhanced Scene Serialization
**File**: `src/editor/SceneManager.cpp`

#### Save Side (Enhanced):
- Added texture path serialization to Sprite component JSON
- Only saves path if texture exists and has a valid file path
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing scene files

```cpp
// Save texture filepath if available
if (sprite.texture && !sprite.texture->getFilePath().empty()) {
    spriteData["texturePath"] = sprite.texture->getFilePath();
}
```

#### Load Side (Enhanced):
- Added texture path deserialization
- Uses ResourceManager to reload texture from saved path
- Provides detailed console output for debugging
- Gracefully handles missing textures

```cpp
// Load texture from saved path
if (spriteData.contains("texturePath")) {
    std::string texturePath = spriteData["texturePath"];
    auto texture = resourceManager->loadTexture(texturePath);
    if (texture) {
        sprite.texture = texture;
        std::cout << "Restored texture: " << texturePath << std::endl;
    }
}
```

### 3. Added Required Dependencies
- Added includes for `Engine.h` and `ResourceManager.h`
- Enables access to ResourceManager for texture loading during scene restoration

## Technical Benefits

### 🎯 **Complete Scene Persistence**
- **All Entity State**: Entities now fully preserve their visual appearance
- **Asset References**: Texture paths are preserved and restored correctly
- **Resource Efficiency**: Uses existing ResourceManager caching system

### 🔧 **Robust Architecture**
- **Future-Proof**: Texture path storage enables advanced features like asset hot-reloading
- **Debug-Friendly**: Console output shows exactly which textures are being restored
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when textures can't be loaded

### 🔄 **Backward Compatibility**
- **Existing Scenes**: Old scene files continue to work (textures just won't be restored)
- **No Migration**: No need to update existing content
- **Progressive Enhancement**: New saves include texture paths automatically

## Validation Results

### ✅ **Build Status**: PASSED
- All compilation errors resolved
- No breaking changes to existing API
- Clean build with new texture path functionality

### 🧪 **Test Scenarios**
1. **Create Scene**: Add entities with assigned textures
2. **Save Scene**: Verify texture paths are serialized to JSON
3. **Load Scene**: Confirm textures are restored via ResourceManager
4. **Visual Verification**: Entities display correct images after load

## Example Scene JSON (New Format)
```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "components": {
        "Sprite": {
          "visible": true,
          "layer": 0,
          "texturePath": "assets/player.png",
          "sourceRectX": 0,
          "sourceRectY": 0,
          "sourceRectW": 32,
          "sourceRectH": 32
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Impact Assessment

### 🚀 **User Experience**
- **Seamless Workflow**: Scenes behave exactly as expected
- **Visual Consistency**: No more missing textures after reload
- **Professional Quality**: Game engine now handles assets like commercial tools

### 💻 **Developer Experience**  
- **Predictable Behavior**: Scene save/load works intuitively
- **Easy Debugging**: Clear console output for texture restoration
- **Asset Management**: Proper integration with ResourceManager

### 🏗️ **System Reliability**
- **Complete State**: Scene serialization is now comprehensive
- **Asset Tracking**: System tracks asset dependencies correctly
- **Error Recovery**: Handles missing assets gracefully

This fix completes the scene save/load system, ensuring that **all entity properties including sprite textures are fully preserved and restored**. The game engine now provides a complete and reliable scene management system suitable for professional game development.
