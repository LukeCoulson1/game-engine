echo ðŸŽ¨ Testing Texture Path Serialization Fix
echo ==========================================
echo.
echo This test verifies that entities retain their sprite images after saving and loading a scene.
echo.

echo ðŸ“‹ Test Steps:
echo 1. Create a new scene with entities that have textures assigned
echo 2. Save the scene 
echo 3. Close/reload the scene
echo 4. Verify entities still have their textures
echo.

echo ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results:
echo - Sprite texture paths are saved to JSON
echo - On load, textures are restored via ResourceManager  
echo - Entities display the same images they had before saving
echo.

echo ðŸ”§ Code Changes Made:
echo - Modified Texture class to store original file path
echo - Updated Renderer::loadTexture to pass filepath to Texture constructor
echo - Enhanced SceneManager to save/load texture paths in Sprite serialization
echo - Added Engine and ResourceManager includes for texture restoration
echo.

echo ðŸš€ Launch the editor and test manually:
echo 1. Create entities and assign textures via Inspector
echo 2. Save the scene via Scene Manager
echo 3. Close and reload the scene  
echo 4. Check that textures are still displayed
echo.
