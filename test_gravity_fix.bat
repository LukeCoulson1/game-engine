echo GRAVITY FIX TEST - No Continuous Downward Movement
echo ================================
echo.
echo This test verifies that entities with PlayerController no longer
echo continuously move downward due to inappropriate gravity application.
echo.
echo ISSUE FIXED:
echo - Previous: Entities would fall continuously downward due to gravity
echo - Fixed: Top-down movement types (default) no longer apply gravity
echo - Gravity only applies to Platformer and Physics movement types
echo.
echo ================================
echo TEST INSTRUCTIONS
echo ================================
echo.
echo 1. Run the editor
echo 2. Create a new entity (Right-click in Scene Window)
echo 3. Add PlayerController via Node Editor (auto-adds required components)
echo 4. Open Game Logic Window
echo 5. Press F5 to start runtime
echo.
echo ================================
echo EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
echo ================================
echo.
echo ✓ NO CONTINUOUS DOWNWARD MOVEMENT:
echo   - Entity should remain stationary when no keys are pressed
echo   - No automatic falling or downward drift
echo   - Entity only moves when WASD keys are pressed
echo.
echo ✓ PROPER WASD MOVEMENT:
echo   - W = Move up (no gravity interference)
echo   - A = Move left
echo   - S = Move down
echo   - D = Move right
echo   - Movement stops immediately when keys are released
echo.
echo ✓ TOP-DOWN MOVEMENT TYPE:
echo   - Default PlayerController uses MovementType::TopDown
echo   - Top-down movement does not apply gravity
echo   - Movement is 8-directional (like Zelda games)
echo.
echo ✓ GRAVITY ONLY FOR PLATFORMERS:
echo   - Gravity only applies to MovementType::Platformer
echo   - Gravity only applies to MovementType::Physics
echo   - MovementType::TopDown, GridBased, FirstPerson = no gravity
echo.
echo ================================
echo TROUBLESHOOTING
echo ================================
echo.
echo If entity still moves downward continuously:
echo 1. Check that MovementType is set to TopDown (default)
echo 2. Verify PlayerPhysics component has reasonable values
echo 3. Ensure entity has all required components
echo 4. Check for external forces being applied
echo.
echo If movement feels wrong:
echo 1. Friction should be 0.85 (reduces velocity when not moving)
echo 2. MaxSpeed should be around 300 pixels/second
echo 3. Movement should feel responsive and stop quickly
echo.

echo LAUNCHING EDITOR
echo ================================
echo.
pause

cd build\bin\Release
start GameEditor.exe

echo.
echo Editor launched! Test the entity movement as described above.

echo TEST RESULTS SUMMARY
echo ================================
echo.
echo Please verify that ALL of the following worked:
echo.
echo [ ] Entity does NOT continuously move downward when stationary
echo [ ] Entity remains in place when no keys are pressed
echo [ ] WASD movement works correctly in all 8 directions
echo [ ] Movement stops immediately when keys are released
echo [ ] No unwanted falling or gravity effects
echo [ ] Movement feels responsive and appropriate for top-down gameplay
echo.
echo If ALL boxes can be checked, the gravity fix is successful!
echo If the entity still moves downward, there may be other issues.
