# Camera Control Window Fix

## Problem Description
The Camera Controls window was operating on the global renderer camera instead of individual scene window cameras, making it ineffective for controlling the camera in specific scene windows.

## Root Cause
The original implementation used:
```cpp
auto renderer = engine.getRenderer();
Vector2 cameraPos = renderer->getCamera();
```

This controlled a global camera that wasn't connected to the individual scene windows, which each have their own independent camera systems.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Active Scene Window Integration
Modified the Camera Controls to operate on the currently active scene window:

```cpp
if (!m_activeSceneWindow) {
    ImGui::Text("❌ No active scene window");
    ImGui::Text("Please create or focus a scene window to control the camera.");
    return;
}

Vector2 cameraPos = m_activeSceneWindow->getCameraPosition();
float zoomLevel = m_activeSceneWindow->getZoomLevel();
```

### 2. Enhanced Camera Controls Interface

#### Scene Information Display
- **Active Scene Name**: Shows which scene window is being controlled
- **Viewport Size**: Displays current scene window dimensions
- **Camera Position**: Real-time camera coordinates
- **Zoom Level**: Current zoom factor
- **Focus Status**: Whether the scene window is currently focused

#### Interactive Controls
- **Camera Position Sliders**: Direct manipulation of X/Y coordinates
- **Zoom Slider**: Continuous zoom control from 0.1x to 10x
- **Quick Zoom Buttons**: 1:1 reset, zoom in/out buttons
- **Camera Position Buttons**: Center camera, reset zoom

#### Visual Feedback
- **World Bounds Display**: Shows visible world area coordinates
- **Real-time Updates**: All values update as you interact with scene windows
- **Console Messages**: Feedback when using quick controls

### 3. Multi-Window Support
The Camera Controls now properly handles multiple scene windows:
- **Active Window Tracking**: Operates on the currently focused scene window
- **Independent Control**: Each scene window maintains its own camera state
- **Seamless Switching**: Clicking between scene windows updates the controls
- **No Interference**: Camera changes don't affect other scene windows

## Technical Implementation

### Key Changes
```cpp
// Before (Global Camera)
Vector2 cameraPos = renderer->getCamera();
if (ImGui::DragFloat2("Camera XY", &cameraPos.x, 1.0f, -10000.0f, 10000.0f)) {
    renderer->setCamera(cameraPos);
}

// After (Scene Window Camera)
Vector2 cameraPos = m_activeSceneWindow->getCameraPosition();
if (ImGui::DragFloat2("Camera XY", &cameraPos.x, 1.0f, -10000.0f, 10000.0f)) {
    m_activeSceneWindow->setCameraPosition(cameraPos);
}
```

### Quick Controls Implementation
```cpp
if (ImGui::Button("Center Camera (0,0)")) {
    m_activeSceneWindow->setCameraPosition(Vector2(0, 0));
    m_consoleMessages.push_back("Camera centered in scene: " + m_activeSceneWindow->getTitle());
}

if (ImGui::Button("Zoom In")) {
    m_activeSceneWindow->zoomIn();
}
```

### World Bounds Calculation
```cpp
float halfWidth = viewportSize.x / (2.0f * zoomLevel);
float halfHeight = viewportSize.y / (2.0f * zoomLevel);
Vector2 topLeft = Vector2(cameraPos.x - halfWidth, cameraPos.y - halfHeight);
Vector2 bottomRight = Vector2(cameraPos.x + halfWidth, cameraPos.y + halfHeight);
```

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Intuitive Operation
- **Clear Context**: Always shows which scene is being controlled
- **Immediate Feedback**: Changes apply instantly to the active scene
- **Visual Confirmation**: Console messages confirm actions

### 2. Multi-Window Workflow
- **Independent Cameras**: Each scene window has its own camera state
- **Easy Switching**: Click between scenes to control different cameras
- **No Confusion**: Clear indication of which scene is active

### 3. Comprehensive Controls
- **Precise Positioning**: Drag sliders for exact camera coordinates
- **Flexible Zooming**: Slider for continuous zoom or buttons for quick changes
- **Quick Actions**: One-click buttons for common camera operations

## Testing Scenarios

### Basic Functionality
1. Create a scene window and open Camera Controls
2. Verify the active scene name is displayed
3. Test camera position sliders
4. Test zoom controls
5. Test quick action buttons

### Multi-Window Testing
1. Create multiple scene windows
2. Add content to different scenes
3. Switch between scene windows
4. Verify Camera Controls updates for each active scene
5. Test independent camera manipulation

### Edge Cases
1. Close all scene windows and verify fallback message
2. Test with very high and low zoom levels
3. Test with extreme camera positions
4. Verify console feedback messages

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Productive Workflow**: Direct control over scene window cameras
- **Multi-Scene Support**: Work with multiple scenes simultaneously
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clear controls with immediate visual feedback
- **Flexible Navigation**: Multiple ways to control camera (sliders, buttons, direct manipulation)

### For Developers
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation between global and scene-specific cameras
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new camera control features
- **Consistent API**: Uses existing SceneWindow camera methods

## Files Modified
- `src/editor/GameEditor.cpp`: Complete rewrite of `showCameraControls()` method

## Integration with Existing Features
- **Scene Window Navigation**: Works with existing click-and-drag panning
- **Mouse-Centered Zoom**: Complements mouse wheel zoom functionality
- **Entity Selection**: Doesn't interfere with entity selection and editing
- **Procedural Generation**: Camera controls work with procedurally generated content

## Future Enhancements
- **Camera Presets**: Save and load camera positions for quick navigation
- **Animation Support**: Smooth camera transitions between positions
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Hotkeys for common camera operations
- **Camera History**: Undo/redo camera movements
