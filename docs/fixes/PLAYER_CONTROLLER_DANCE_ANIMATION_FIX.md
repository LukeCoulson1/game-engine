# Player Controller Dance Animation Fix

## Issues Resolved

### 1. No More Dance Animation on Startup
**Problem**: When starting the Game Logic Window runtime, a dance animation would automatically execute.

**Solution**: 
- Cleaned up the `executeUserCode()` method in `GameLogicWindow.cpp` to be a simple placeholder that only marks the scene as dirty for re-rendering.
- The method no longer contains any automatic animation code.
- Runtime updates are now handled entirely by the PlayerSystem for input processing.

### 2. Player Controller Not Working
**Problem**: User could not control entities with WASD keys even when PlayerController component was added.

**Root Cause**: The PlayerSystem's `isPlayerEntity()` method requires entities to have ALL of these components:
- PlayerController
- PlayerStats  
- PlayerPhysics

However, when users added only a PlayerController component via the node editor, the entity was not recognized as a player entity.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `NodeEditor.cpp` to automatically add all required player components when a PlayerController is added:
  - PlayerStats (health, mana, experience, etc.)
  - PlayerPhysics (velocity, acceleration, collision)
  - PlayerState (current state, facing direction)
  - PlayerAbilities (skills, cooldowns)

## Code Changes

### GameLogicWindow.cpp - executeUserCode()
```cpp
void GameLogicWindow::executeUserCode() {
    // Execute the user's updateGame function directly on the active scene
    // This allows live gameplay in the scene window!
    if (!m_activeScene || !m_activeScene->getScene()) return;
    
    auto scene = m_activeScene->getScene();
    
    // TODO: In a real implementation, you'd compile and execute the user's code
    // For now, this is a placeholder that doesn't run any automatic animations
    
    // Mark the scene as dirty so player controller changes get re-rendered
    m_activeScene->setDirty(true);
}
```

### NodeEditor.cpp - Auto-Add Player Components
```cpp
case NodeType::PlayerController:
    if (!scene->hasComponent<PlayerController>(entity)) {
        scene->addComponent<PlayerController>(entity, *std::static_pointer_cast<PlayerController>(componentNode->componentData));
        
        // Auto-add required PlayerSystem components
        if (!scene->hasComponent<PlayerStats>(entity)) {
            scene->addComponent<PlayerStats>(entity, PlayerStats());
        }
        if (!scene->hasComponent<PlayerPhysics>(entity)) {
            scene->addComponent<PlayerPhysics>(entity, PlayerPhysics());
        }
        if (!scene->hasComponent<PlayerState>(entity)) {
            scene->addComponent<PlayerState>(entity, PlayerState());
        }
        if (!scene->hasComponent<PlayerAbilities>(entity)) {
            scene->addComponent<PlayerAbilities>(entity, PlayerAbilities());
        }
    }
    break;
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Create Entity**: Right-click in Scene Window to create a new entity
2. **Add PlayerController**: Right-click entity → Open Node Editor → Add PlayerController component
3. **Verify Auto-Components**: The system automatically adds PlayerStats, PlayerPhysics, PlayerState, and PlayerAbilities
4. **Test Movement**: Open Game Logic Window → Press F5 → Use WASD keys to move
5. **Verify No Dance**: Confirm no dance animation plays automatically
6. **Check Debug**: Look for key press debug messages in the console

## Expected Behavior

- **No automatic animations** when runtime starts
- **WASD movement** works immediately after adding PlayerController
- **Debug logging** shows key presses in the Game Logic Window console
- **Smooth movement** with acceleration and deceleration
- **Running** with Shift key (faster movement)
- **Jump** with Space key (if physics enabled)

## User Experience Improvements

1. **One-Click Setup**: Users only need to add PlayerController - all required components are added automatically
2. **Clear Instructions**: Updated code template provides clear setup instructions
3. **Debug Feedback**: Console shows key press events for troubleshooting
4. **No Unwanted Behavior**: Clean runtime startup without automatic animations

## Files Modified

- `src/editor/GameLogicWindow.cpp` - Cleaned executeUserCode method
- `src/editor/NodeEditor.cpp` - Auto-add player components
- `test_no_dance_animation.bat` - Updated test script
- `PLAYER_CONTROLLER_DANCE_ANIMATION_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Both issues resolved:
- Dance animation no longer plays automatically on runtime startup
- Player controller works immediately after adding PlayerController component
- All required components are automatically added
- User experience is streamlined and intuitive
