## Architecture Overview

The engine systems are built on several key architectural principles:

### Entity-Component-System (ECS)
- **Entities**: Unique identifiers for game objects
- **Components**: Data containers for entity properties
- **Systems**: Logic processors that operate on entities with specific components

### Core Systems Integration
- **Rendering System**: Handles all visual output and GPU communication
- **Physics System**: Manages collision detection and response
- **Input System**: Processes user input and distributes events
- **Audio System**: Manages sound effects and music playback
- **Resource System**: Handles asset loading and memory management

### Performance Considerations
- **Component Storage**: Optimized memory layouts for cache efficiency
- **System Update Order**: Carefully orchestrated system execution
- **Multi-threading**: Parallel processing where appropriate
- **Memory Management**: Efficient allocation and deallocation strategies
