# Scene Window Isolation - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The game engine editor has been successfully modified to ensure that sprites and procedural generation content only appear within their respective scene windows, not in the program background.

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Background Rendering
- **File**: `src/editor/GameEditor.cpp` - `render()` method
- **Change**: The main render method now only clears the background with a solid color (45, 45, 48)
- **Result**: No scene content is rendered in the global program background

```cpp
// Clear background only - scene content is now rendered within scene windows
renderer->clear(Color(45, 45, 48));

// Note: Scene content is now rendered within individual SceneWindow instances
// Each SceneWindow handles its own scene rendering using ImGui draw lists
```

### 2. Scene-Specific Rendering
- **File**: `src/editor/SceneWindow.cpp` - `renderSceneContent()` method
- **Implementation**: Each SceneWindow renders its scene content using ImGui draw lists within the window bounds
- **Features**:
  - Sprites are rendered as actual texture images scaled to fit 32x32 tiles
  - Entity names are displayed next to entities
  - Selected entities are highlighted with colored borders
  - Camera position is scene-window specific
  - Supports proper texture scaling while maintaining aspect ratios
  - **Zoom functionality**: Mouse wheel and keyboard controls for zooming in/out
  - **Smart grid**: Grid overlay that scales with zoom level and disappears when too small

### 3. Procedural Generation Targeting
- **File**: `src/editor/GameEditor.cpp` - Procedural generation methods
- **Implementation**: All procedural generation (dungeon, city, terrain) checks for and uses the active scene window
- **Safety**: If no active scene window exists, generation is prevented with error messages

#### Example Implementation:
```cpp
if (!m_activeSceneWindow || !m_activeSceneWindow->getScene()) {
    m_consoleMessages.push_back("❌ No active scene window! Create a scene window first.");
    return;
}

auto activeScene = m_activeSceneWindow->getScene();
// Generate content to activeScene only
m_proceduralManager->generateMapToScene(m_currentMap, activeScene.get());
```

### 4. Asset Assignment
- **File**: `src/editor/GameEditor.cpp` - `showAssetBrowser()` method
- **Implementation**: Asset assignment (textures) targets entities in the active scene window only
- **Result**: Images assigned from the Asset Browser only affect entities in the currently active scene

### 5. Multi-Window Support
- **Active Window Tracking**: The editor tracks which scene window is currently active
- **Camera Independence**: Each scene window has its own camera position
- **Dirty State**: Each scene window maintains its own dirty state for unsaved changes

### 6. Zoom Functionality
- **Mouse Wheel**: Scroll up to zoom in, scroll down to zoom out
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
  - `+` or `Numpad +`: Zoom in
  - `-` or `Numpad -`: Zoom out
  - `1`: Reset zoom to 1.0x
- **Menu Controls**: View menu contains zoom options
- **Zoom Range**: Limited from 0.1x to 10x for usability
- **Smart Scaling**: All elements (sprites, dots, grid) scale proportionally with zoom
- **Zoom Display**: Current zoom level shown in scene window header (e.g., "Zoom: 1.5x")

## User Experience

### What Users See:
1. **Clean Background**: The main editor background is a solid gray color with no sprites or generated content
2. **Isolated Content**: Each scene window contains only its own entities and generated content
3. **Multi-Scene Editing**: Users can have multiple scene windows open simultaneously, each with different content
4. **Clear Feedback**: Console messages indicate which scene window is being affected by operations

### Workflow:
1. Create a new scene window (File → New Scene Window)
2. Select the desired scene window to make it active
3. Use procedural generation or add sprites - they only affect the active scene
4. Multiple scene windows can be open with completely different content

## Technical Benefits

1. **Memory Efficiency**: No unnecessary rendering in the background
2. **Performance**: Rendering is optimized to only draw content within visible scene windows
3. **User Control**: Clear separation between different scenes and their content
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add more scene windows without affecting performance

## Files Modified

- `src/editor/GameEditor.cpp`: Main editor logic, procedural generation, asset browser
- `src/editor/SceneWindow.cpp`: Scene-specific rendering and camera handling
- `src/editor/SceneWindow.h`: Scene window interface
- `src/editor/GameEditor.h`: Active scene window tracking

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- ✅ No sprites appear in the program background
- ✅ Procedural generation only affects the target scene window
- ✅ Multiple scene windows can have different content simultaneously
- ✅ Asset assignment works correctly with the active scene window
- ✅ Camera controls are independent per scene window

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Multi-selection across scene windows
- Scene window tabs for better organization
- Minimap for large procedurally generated areas
- Advanced texture filtering and scaling options
