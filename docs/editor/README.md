# Editor Tools and Interfaces

This directory contains documentation for the editor-specific tools, interfaces, and workflows in the 2D Game Engine.

## Node Editor

- **[Node Editor Resize Guide](NODE_EDITOR_RESIZE_GUIDE.md)**
  - Node editor interface layout and resizing
  - UI responsiveness and user experience improvements
  - Component node management and organization

## Window Management

- **[Window State Persistence](Window_State_Persistence.md)**
  - Editor window layout preservation
  - UI state saving and restoration
  - Multi-window workflow optimization

## Editor Architecture

### Core Editor Components

#### Scene Window
- **Primary viewport** for scene visualization and editing
- **Real-time rendering** with immediate visual feedback
- **Entity selection** and manipulation tools
- **Camera controls** for navigation and framing

#### Node Editor
- **Visual component editing** with node-based interface
- **Real-time property updates** with immediate scene reflection
- **Component relationships** visualization
- **Drag-and-drop** component management

#### Inspector Panel
- **Component property editing** with type-specific controls
- **Asset reference management** with drag-and-drop support
- **Multi-entity editing** for batch operations
- **Custom component** support and extensibility

#### Game Logic Window
- **Runtime testing** environment with live gameplay
- **Code editor** for custom logic implementation
- **Console output** for debugging and logging
- **Performance monitoring** and profiling tools

### Editor Workflow

#### Scene Creation
1. **Create new scene** or load existing scene file
2. **Add entities** using the scene hierarchy
3. **Configure components** through the inspector or node editor
4. **Test gameplay** using the Game Logic Window
5. **Save scene** with all entity and component data

#### Asset Management
1. **Import assets** through the folder browser
2. **Organize assets** in the project directory structure
3. **Configure asset properties** through the inspector
4. **Reference assets** in components via drag-and-drop

#### Debugging Workflow
1. **Start runtime** in the Game Logic Window
2. **Monitor performance** through built-in profiling tools
3. **Check console output** for errors and debug messages
4. **Use step-by-step debugging** for complex issues
5. **Profile memory usage** and rendering performance

### Editor Extensions

The editor is designed to be extensible through:

- **Custom Components**: Add new component types with automatic editor support
- **Custom Systems**: Integrate new game systems with editor visualization
- **Custom Tools**: Add specialized editing tools for specific workflows
- **Custom Windows**: Create new editor windows for specialized functionality

### Performance Considerations

#### Real-time Updates
- **Selective updates**: Only update changed components
- **Batch operations**: Group similar operations for efficiency
- **Lazy evaluation**: Defer expensive operations until needed
- **Caching strategies**: Cache frequently accessed data

#### Memory Management
- **Asset streaming**: Load assets on-demand
- **Component pooling**: Reuse component instances
- **Garbage collection**: Minimize memory allocations
- **Resource cleanup**: Proper cleanup of editor resources
