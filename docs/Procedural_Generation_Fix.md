# Testing Procedural Generation - Quick Fix Guide

## The Issue
When generating procedural content (cities, dungeons, terrain), the generated content wasn't visible because:

1. **Sprites weren't being assigned textures** - The Sprite components were created but empty
2. **Camera wasn't positioned to view the content** - Generated content was at (0,0) but camera stayed at default position

## The Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Sprite Assignment
- Updated `generateToScene()` to properly load textures using ResourceManager
- Fixed the texture assignment to use the correct `texture` field instead of non-existent `texturePath`
- Added proper texture loading with error handling

### 2. Fixed Camera Positioning  
- After generation, camera automatically moves to view the center of the generated map
- Calculates proper camera position based on map size and window dimensions
- Added console messages to confirm camera movement

### 3. Improved Tile Positioning
- Added `getWorldPosition()` overload that accepts custom tile size
- Ensures tiles are positioned correctly in world space

## Testing Steps

1. **Open the GameEditor**
2. **Open the Procedural Generation panel** (from Windows menu)
3. **Try generating a city:**
   - Set width/height (e.g., 50x50)
   - Click "Generate City"
   - You should now see the generated city
   - Camera will automatically move to show the content

4. **Check the console messages** - You should see:
   - "Generated city 50x50 (seed: [number])"
   - "Camera moved to view generated content"

## Troubleshooting

### If you still don't see content:

1. **Check if sprite images exist**:
   - Look in `assets/images/` folder
   - Make sure you have city sprite files like `city_road.png`, `city_house.png`, etc.
   - Use the "Tile Image Assignment" section to verify/assign sprites

2. **Try manual camera movement**:
   - Open Camera Controls panel
   - Try moving camera to (0,0) or (800, 600)
   - Use arrow keys or WASD if camera controls are implemented

3. **Check console for errors**:
   - Look at the Console panel in the editor
   - Check for texture loading failures

### Default Tile Sprites Expected:

**City Generation:**
- `city_road.png` - for roads
- `city_house.png` - for houses  
- `city_shop.png` - for shops
- `city_building.png` - for buildings

**Dungeon Generation:**
- `dungeon_wall.png` - for walls
- `dungeon_floor.png` - for floors
- `dungeon_door.png` - for doors

**Terrain Generation:**
- `terrain_grass.png` - for grass
- `terrain_water.png` - for water
- `terrain_stone.png` - for stone
- `terrain_tree.png` - for trees

## Next Steps

If generation works but you want to improve it:

1. **Add more sprite varieties** - Use the tile assignment UI
2. **Adjust generation parameters** - Experiment with different settings
3. **Save/load maps** - Use the map management features
4. **Create custom themes** - Set up your own sprite themes

The procedural generation should now be fully functional!
